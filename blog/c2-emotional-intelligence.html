			<h1>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h1>
				<p>
					The most fascinating thing about emotional intelligence is that it can be learnt, by anyone willing to put the time and effort into it. I've seen how important having emotional intelligence can impact the workspace in a positive way. Its interesting to see that having emotional intelligence is regarded as some of the most important traits people look for in others when hiring.

	 		<h1>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h1>
 				<p> I practice mindfulness meditation at work everyday for 10-15 minutes using the headspace app. it gives me time to pause and reflect on my thoughts and to bring focus and clarity to my daily workflow. Often times, after doing mindfulness, I find myself in quite a reflective state. I thoroughly enjoy it, as our minds can often become overly cluttered with thoughts, and its very easy to loose touch with whats important to you.
