<h1>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h1>
<p>
	Frameworks are a skeleton to your website, often code is written for you and you can tweak the odd code to make it your own. the limitations with frameworks is that it doesn't teach you how to develop, but rather gives you the coding. apart from this, it can be difficult to make the website look the way you want it to look without starting completely from scratch

<h1> What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h1>
<p>
	A wireframe allows us to visualise our website prior to us writing code. its a lot easier when you have a visual reference prior to coding, otherwise you end up redoing code without an end goal in mind
