    <h1>Time and habit techniques</h1>
    <h2>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
      <p>I've been using the timer technique for some time, 25 min 'sprint' with a 5 minute break. I've found by breaking these tasks down into thost time periods, I get the most done. Often times, im most productive in the morning, once my brain has had the time to rest. I think its a habit I've formed since a child</p>
    <h2>what did you find interesting?</h2>
      <p>Carol Dweck growth mindset, as I think we're all malable and able to continuously grow</p>
    <h2>what worked for you?</h2>
      <p>The timing tech technique works best for me</p>
    <h2> which will you experiment further with?</h2>
      <p>probably the building a habit technique, and breaking it down into smaller, achievable goals</p>
