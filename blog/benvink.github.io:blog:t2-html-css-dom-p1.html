      <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
      <p>
       HTML is essentially a house, with 4 walls and a roof. CSS is the decoration that goes into the house, color of the walls, etc. DOM is the blueprint of how the house will look, how everything will work together

      <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
      <p>
        Boxifying design means to lay every design element out into boxes. this is the way CSS is structured. everything you see on the page has a box around it. boxifying quantifies the elements to fit the structure of a page
      </p>
      <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
      <p>

        the box model is a series of retagular boxes laid out according to a visual design. it helps web developers to determine where each piece of infomation will go on the page. box model takes into account an element called <em>div</em>. a div is a way of labelling, so the designer will know how to design every element.
