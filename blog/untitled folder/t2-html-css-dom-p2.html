    <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>Grid based design is the process of boxing every element on a page page, so that each element fits into a vertical and horizontal design. This makes it easier for webdevelopers to lay out a blueprint to what the page will eventually look like</p>
    <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p>Today people access the internet on various platforms (phones, tablets, TVs even smart watches). Each one of these devices has different size screens. its imparative that the user experience is not hampered when people access webpages through these devices, therefore responsive webpages rendors the page to load according to the device that it is on. </p>
    <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
      <p>Semantic structure can be thought of as a blueprint to the webpage, each element represents specific instructions for a computer to render and for us as humans to understand. When building a website, semantic structure helps a web developer build an easy to follow list of instructions so that another web developer can easily see the structure, and make changes where necessary.</p>
    <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
      <p>I found the responsive webpage part particularly interesting as today there are so many different ways to access the internet. its interesting to see how that looks from a coding perspective, and how the code will automatically interpret what the pixel sizes are</p>
