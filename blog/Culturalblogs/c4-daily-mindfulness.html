	 <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
      <p>Mindfulness is the skill that gives you the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again. “We take for granted many of the neutral things in life, such as not being in pain. Communication is the process of exchanging information between others, whether that be written, spoken or using some other medium. However, effective communication takes place when both parties actively listen to each other. I found with mindfulness you’re able to clearly focus on the other person and truly listen to what they have to say. This leads to much deeper conversations and results in you having a bigger impact on them, forging lasting relationships. I watched an interesting movie called Her, which delves into these communication aspects and how they relate to humans. One of my key takeaways was that it's important to listen wholly and with intent. </p>
  <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
      <p> I already often practice walking meditation. I find it allows me to get lost in my thoughts, and to look at them objectively. another technique I would like to develop is deep focus on activities. often I find myself getting distracted very easily. through practice in mindfulnes, I've only really started to realise the postive benefits to it. Lastly, I think its important to develop a mindful conversation. I think far to often we're caught up in ourselves, and don't spend the time in actively listening those important to us </p>
  <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p> I think the difficult part to mindfulness is to make it a daily practice, and make it a habit. We practice it at work, but even then we find that meetings and phone calls take presecedent. Through making it a priority, we would benefit from in greatly in other areas of our lives</p>
