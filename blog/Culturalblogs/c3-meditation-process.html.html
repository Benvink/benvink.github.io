	  <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
	  <p>
	  	Well I was quite stubborn and wanted product over process. which resulted in roughly a 20h build time. Next time its best that I focus on process first and then add the finishing touches. Big learning curve for me
	  </p>
	  <h3> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
	  <p>
	  	Throughout my life, I've been exposed to meditation practice, as my mum is a big advocate. However, only in the last couple of years have I started to pay attention to the benefits of it. Being able to objectively look at thought, without judgement is a skill on its own.</p>
 	<h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
 		<p>
 			Medidation can be powerful for a multitude of situations. I heard an anology once that said your thoughts are like clouds, just noise, going above that you see calm. being able to meditate brings those thoughts into focus, and allows you to view them without judgement, understand them and learn to over time be aware of them in specific situations
 		</p>
 	<h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
 		<p>one of the suggested meditations techniques that I find works the best is to have a ratio of 1 in breath for every 2 out breaths. so in other words, breathing in for 1 second and breathing out for 2. when I do this, I get the sense that im ridding myself of distraction and focusing on the breath more intently. Additionally, breathing through the nose and out through the mouth is a huge help. our noses have evolved to be intrict breathing mechanisms, designed to determine the immediate surroundings. when you breath through your nose, it triggers brain activity to tell and puts it in a state of calm</p>
 	<h3>Any other musings?</h3>
 		<p>
 			keeping the habit of meditation or taking a moment just to breath everyday is a good habit to establish, as it can bring a sense of calm to any situation. I've found that through breathing prior to a meeting, or to a anxious situation, it alters my mindset to say "okay i'm ready for this, lets go".
