	 <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
      <p> my experience so far has been quite immersive, as a week ago I had no idea how to write any form of command line, or git or interact with github. its been a much more fruitful experience than if I had done this by myself. I think by having the framework in place, by having mentors, and guidance, helps me to broaden my knowledge and engages me to learn more. 
  <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p> So far I feel well equiped to learn the basics, with loads of materials to go delve into. The support has been there when I've needed it, however I think I would have struggled had it not been for the developers in my workplace. They've been showing me the ropes, and been more than happy to explain things when they don't make sense</p>
  <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p> By working in a company culture that nurtures the feeling of vulnerability, I think I've already had quite extensive experience with this type of culture. its important to be modest, and admit when things don't quite make sense. Currently, im reading a book by Yuval Noah Harari entitled Sapians, which entails our history and why we are who we are today. One chapter mentions the reason Europeans became superpowers. In essence there were no technological or sociopolitical differences between European empires, Chinese empires or Umayyad Caliphat empires. However, European superpowers became comfortable with their ingnorance and seeked to question their knowledge more and more. obviously there are myriad of arguements that state Europeans, in their quest for knowledge did not seek it peacefully. However, underlying all this was the unfathomed thirst for being curious. I think that by having this unquenchable thirst for knowledge, will only benefit yourself and those around you. What I loved about the initial task, explaining in laymans terms, what a command line was and various commands, was that you needed to know so well what the command line did that you could make it as simple as possible. I think if we can approach every challenge, every line of code, and every task with an open mind set, it will only help us in our future endevours. </p>
  <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p> I wouldn't say changed, just reinforced what I was already aware of in the first place. As I've heard a lot about these bootcamps, I've been able to approach it with a open mind, and understand what EDA has set out to acheive. I think by having certain expectations, you set yourself up for failure. I can defnitely resonate with the imposter syndrome though. Being a youngster in a start up, really made me feel like I was comepletely out of my league. However, I've used that feeling to energise me to know and understand more, and really delve into every aspect of my role.</p>

  <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p> This past week has been a roller coaster of excitement and nervouseness. I went from my gosh I can't wait to start, to how the hell am I going to do this 25 hours per week, I won't have any time to do anything else, to this command line is quite easy to omg why isn't my git working. I think this is normal. I think at the moment, I've been disrupted, my comfort zone has shifted and im finding my feet. It'll take time, but overall I would say excited to participate really.</p>
